## How to Use
<hr/>

    The user can simply enter a few letters of the name they are looking for and press the search button. There is also a table of all employee names by default where it will be updated by changing the search keyword.
    There is also an auto complete feature which gets updated by entering letters of the name in the search box.
    The user can update the sorting criteria at the begining of the application. However, because this application is not using hooks or context, after pressing the search button, for updating the sort criteria, the search button should be clicked again.
    In the future developments, the render-on-change feature will be added.
